# KazrobotiX-s-weed-detection-Yolov8-model
This repository contains my custom-trained YOLOv8 model for weed detection, designed to identify and eliminate weeds using computer vision (CV).

This project was my 2024 summer research, where I utilized an NVIDIA Jetson developer kit and electromagnetic valves to autonomously spray herbicides.

I have uploaded multiple models, including:

Weed detection using YOLOv8
Color detection for distinguishing vegetables and various field objects like stones and debris

All models were trained on my own datasets, which were not sourced from Kaggle or GitHub. 
Don't forget to change your code while uploading files, I have MACos.
